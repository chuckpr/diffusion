      "This is the equation that relates centrifugal force and brownian motion. Solving it gives you the guassian curve for concentration versus radius. The guassian shape is a balance beteen diffusive flux and flux due to the buoyant force. The term on the left accounts for the centrifugal force, buoyant force, and Stoke's law. The term on the right is the diffusion term representing the work done when a molecule goes against the concentration gradient."
